**YAPI Viewer** (Yet Another PIcture Viewer) is a web image viewer that can be easily added to any web site. In-line picture editing is also supported. Its implementation is based solely on the canvas element of HTML5, javascript and CSS. It works in all major browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror. In addition, it offers a range of customisation options to suit the needs of any website.

**YAPI Viewer** displays your images into a box consisting of specific buttons for zoom/pan and rotation and sliders for brightness/contrast adjustment. It can be typically added to any HTML page in no more than 5 minutes. It has been developed by the Hellenic National Documentation Center (EKT/NHRF, http://www.ekt.gr) as part of an internally funded project.

You can view and test **YAPI Viewer** by navigating in the various digital collections of  the [PANDEKTIS](http://pandektis.ekt.gr) repository, the digital  repository of the National Hellenic Research Foundation containing primary sources of Greek history and culture. For example, you can check YAPI Viewer in action [here](http://pandektis.ekt.gr/dspace/handle/123456789/70946/), inside a collection of ancient Greek and Roman inscriptions.
